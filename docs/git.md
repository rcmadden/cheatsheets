[My notes](https://rcmadden.github.io/notes/#/git-version-control) of basic commands for getting re-started using git from [Udacityâ€™s Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123) free course completed 2/2021, the [Atlasian Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials), [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs) plus random notes I have stashed in several locations from previous experience.

## Creating a Repo
### Empty Directory
Initialize an empty Git repository in the current directory
```bash 
git init
```
Setup a remote repo on github or bitbucket
```bash 
git remote add <remote_name> <remote_repo_url>
git push -u <remote_name> <local_branch_name>
```
Example:
```bash 
git push -u origin main
```
### Existing Directory with Files
```bash 
cd /path/to/my/code
git init   #(1)
git add .  #(2)
git commit #(3)
```
1.  Inside code directory initialize a /path/to/my/code/**.git directory**.
2.  Add all existing files to the index.
3.  Record the pristine state as the first commit in the history.

### Clone Existing Repo
```bash
git clone <repo>
git fetch # will update all the remote-tracking branches
git pull # will in addition merge the remote master branch into the current master branch
```
### Add and Commit All (single command) 
```sh
git commit -am 'commit message'
```
This does not work with new files, which requires the capitalized -A flag
```sh 
git commit -A
git commit -m 'commit message'
```

### Edit Last Commit Message
```
git commit --amend
```
In the text editor, edit the message and close the file.

## Branching

### List Branches
list all branches in local and remote repositories:
``` 
git branch -a 
```
list remote branches:
``` 
git branch -r
```
list branches and their commits:
``` 
git show-branch
```

### Merge a Git Branch into main 6 steps
source: https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/git/best-and-safe-way-to-merge-a-git-branch-into-master.html
#### 1. Git fetching
Get the latest updates of your repository to your branch
```
git fetch
```
#### 2. Git rebasing
Brign the latest commits of main to your branch
note: in the cases when there are changes on the master branch pushed from a different developer, a conflict can occur while trying to push your merge back. For this reason, always do a rebase before merge.
``` 
git rebase origin/main
```
#### 3. Switch to main
```
git checkout main
```
#### 4. Pulling changes
``` 
git pull origin main
```
#### 5. Merging changes
```
git merge test
```
#### 6. Pushing changes
Final step is push local changes to the remote repo
```
git push origin main
```



### Switching Unstagged Changes to a New Branch
``` 
git switch -c new-branch-name
```

### Delete Branch
Move to different branch
#### Delete Local Branch
``` 
git branch --delete branch-name
```
#### Delete Remote Branch
```
git push origin -d branch-name
```
where "orign" is the remote-name

#### Rename Local Branch and Remote Branch
##### 1. Rename branch locally  
```
git branch -m old_branch new_branch
```
##### 2.  Delete the old branch  
```
git push origin :old_branch
```
##### 3.  Push the new branch
and set local branch to track the new remote branch  
```
git push --set-upstream origin new_branch
```

### .gitignore

[Add .DS_Store in all sub-directories to .gitignore](https://gist.github.com/rcmadden/ed57a253474c833eba01f7eaca6ec374#file-add-ds_store-into-gitignore-for-the-sub-directory-md)
```
**/.DS_Store
```

## Issues and Errors
### git push says "everything up-to-date" even though I have local changes

git push origin master

And it shows the message Everything up-to-date.

to fix this this issue, try these steps

```
git add .
git commit -m "Bug Fixed"
git push -u origin master
```

)

### .gitignore not working
how to ignore file that is being tracked by git

First commit any outstanding code changes, and then, run this command:
```
git rm --cached filename
```
This removes any changed files from the index(staging area):
```
git rm -r --cached .
git add .
```
Commit change:
```
git commit -m ".gitignore is now working"
```
